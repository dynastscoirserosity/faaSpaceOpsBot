# faaSpaceBot

FAA Space Ops Bot is a bot that automatically scrapes the US Federal Aviation Administration's [Current Operations Plan Advisory](https://www.fly.faa.gov/adv/adv_spt.jsp) specifically for space related acitivities, parses that information and formats it for publishing on social networks.

Currently, the code provides the ability to post directly to Twitter/X using Twitter/X's API.
